    "# Object Detection and Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to learn about different algorithms available for object tracking and thier usage. Object detection and tracking has been a great problem in computer vision for ages. To tackle this problem many people have comeup with different ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform video tracking an algorithm analyzes sequential video frames and outputs the movement of targets between the frames. There are a variety of algorithms, each having strengths and weaknesses. Considering the intended use is important when choosing which algorithm to use. There are two major components of a visual tracking system: target representation and localization, as well as filtering and data association.\n",

    "## Meanshift \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean-shift algorithm is an efficient approach to tracking objects whose appearance is defined by histograms. (not limited by colour ). To understand this concept intuitively, see the pictures below. The main objective of the algorithm is to maximise the density of the ROI (Region of Interest). So the algorithm iteratively, moves the ROI such that after each iteration distance between centroid and center of the ROI decreases. This is pictorially depicted below (the points can be a pixel distribution like histogram backprojection)..\n",
    "\n",
    "![Iteration 1](Selection_001.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The orange point indicates the centroid or centre of mass of all the points in the ROI. The blue point indicates the center of the ROI. Sothe vector joining these two points as shown in the image, represents the movement of the center of the ROI in the next iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Iteration 2](Selection_002.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when compared to the previous image, ROI has moved along that vector(calculated during the previous iteration). Now a new set of points come into ROI. This changes the position of the center of mass of the ROI. So this algorithm iteratively minimizes the distance between the center and centroid of the ROI. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Iteration 3](Selection_003.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the mean shift algorithm. So how is it useful in computer vision's object tracking???\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "So we normally pass the histogram backprojected image and initial target location. When the object moves, obviously the movement is reflected in histogram backprojected image. As a result, meanshift algorithm moves our window to the new location with maximum density. \n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor widely employed on several domains to characterize objects through their shapes. Local object appearance and shape can often be described by the distribution of local intensity gradients or edge directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOG is widely utilized as a feature described image region for object detection such as human face or human body detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below roughly describes the sequence of procedures we follow while using Histogram of Oriented Gradients as features\n",
    "\n",
    "![HOG_FlowChart](hog-object-detection-sequence1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input in the chart, is generally the image we want to classify. The first procedure is Gamma and Color normalisation. This normalisation is done to increase the efficiency of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The object search is based on the detection technique applied for the small images defined by sliding detector window that probes region by region of the original input image and its scaled versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![sliding_window](sliding_window_example.gif)\n",
    "This is an example of the sliding a window approach, where we slide a window from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. **Note** : Only a single scale is shown. In practice this window would be applied to multiple scales of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first step in HOG detection is to divide the source image into blocks (for example 16×16 pixels). Each block is divided by small regions, called cells (for example 8×8 pixels). Usually blocks overlap each other, so that the same cell may be in several blocks. For each pixel within the cell the vertical and horizontal gradients are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simplest method used to compute image gradients is to use 1-D Sobel vertical and horizontal operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Gx(y,x) = Y(y,x+1) – Y(y,x-1)**\n",
    "\n",

    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gradients of the image can be calculated by convolving the image with Sobel_x and Sobel_y kernels. Okay, now we have obtained directional derivatives, but how to compute gradient at that point? We can compute the gradient magnitude and phase we will use this formula.\n",

For the histogram, Q bins for the angle are chosen (for example Q=9 => 20 degrees per bin). Usually unsigned orientation is used, so angles below 0 are increased by 180. For each gradient vector, it’s contribution to the histogram is given by the magnitude of the vector (so stronger gradients have a bigger impact on the histogram). We split the contribution between the two closest bins. So, for example, if a gradient vector has an angle of 85 degrees, then we add 1/4th of its magnitude to the bin centered at 70 degrees, and 3/4ths of its magnitude to the bin centered at 90.\n",
