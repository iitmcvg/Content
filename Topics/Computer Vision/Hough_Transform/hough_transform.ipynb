This representation is used in OpenCV). Check below image:\n",

If it is going above the origin, instead of taking angle greater than 180, angle is taken less than 180, and rho is taken negative. Any vertical line will have 0 degree and horizontal lines will have 90 degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s see how Hough Transform works for lines. Any line can be represented in these two terms, (𝜌, 𝜃). So first it creates a 2D array or accumulator (to hold values of two parameters) and it is set to 0 initially. Let rows denote the 𝜌 and columns denote the 𝜃. Size of array depends on the accuracy you need. Suppose you want the accuracy of angles to be 1 degree, you need 180 columns. For 𝜌, the maximum distance possible is the diagonal length of the image. So taking one pixel accuracy, number of rows can be diagonal length of the image."

Now in the line equation, put the values 𝜃 = 0, 1, 2, ...., 180 and check the 𝜌 you get. For every (𝜌, 𝜃) pair, you increment value by one in our accumulator in its corresponding (𝜌, 𝜃) cells. So now in accumulator, the cell (50,90) = 1 along with some other cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now take the second point on the line. Do the same as above. Increment the the values in the cells corresponding to (𝜌, 𝜃) you got. This time, the cell (50,90) = 2. What you actually do is voting the (𝜌, 𝜃) values. You continue this process for every point on the line. At each point, the cell (50,90) will be incremented or voted up, while other cells may or may not be voted up. This way, at the end, the cell (50,90) will have maximum votes. So if you search the accumulator for maximum votes, you get the value (50,90) which says, there is a line in this image at distance 50 from origin and at angle 90 degrees."
