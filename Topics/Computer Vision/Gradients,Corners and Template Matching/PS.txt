PROBLEM STATEMENTS FOR JULY 7th

1)
Gradients and edges in an image are usually used to discard the large amount of irrelevant data in an image and consider only what is necessary for solving the problem.
Gradients are used in edge detection as well.
Find the Sobel, Scharr and Laplacian derivatives and the edges with the canny edge detector for the image given(img1.jpg).
Play with the possible arguments for the functions.

2)
Corners are among the best features to find while attempting to solve practical problems.
Harris and Shi-Tomasi detector corner detectors are a part of opencv.
Find the corners in img1.jpg using both and compare the two methods by solving PS_July_7_CD.ipynb 

3)
Template matching is a brute-force searching method to find a particular object in an image.
It can be made scale-invariant but fails when the orientation of the object is changed.
Find the location of the center of the ball in the given football field.
(Extra : Try solving Where's Waldo? with template matching)

4)
Refer to https://docs.google.com/document/d/13CJgtDr8kIX9KIrs6BYFDF6-N7cfAyX0R54v8CWoqmQ/pub?embedded=true

5)
Given an image(img3.jpg) with many coloured shapes find and display the number of red, green and blue circles respectively.
(Hint : Use HSV and Hough transform)
