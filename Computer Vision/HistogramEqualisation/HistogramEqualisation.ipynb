    "## What is Histogram??\n",
    "\n",
    "In Statistics, Histogram is a graphical representation showing a visual impression of the distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![exams](exams.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can note in the image above that vividly shows the distribution of marks\n",
    "of a class. Along X-axis we have marks bins (each of 10 Marks width) and histograms describes how the marks of the class is spread among students. Moreover we can note that less students have got marks between 90-100 and 0-10. Many students have got marks between 50-60 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram in the context of image processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, image processing histogram normally refers to the histogram of pixel intensity values. For an 8-bit gray scale image, we have 256 possible intensity values (0 to 255) => we have 256 divisions along x axis, each representing gray scale intesities and histogram(as in the case of exams) show the distribution of pixels  amongst those gray scale values. \n",

    "![histogramexample](histogramexample.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Its usually advised to normalize a histogram by dividing each of its value by total number of pixels in that image, thus forming a normalised histogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "This normalised histogram can be interpreted probability functions that denote the probability of occurrence of a gray scale intensity rk (just a variable) in the image. But it goes without mentioning that sum of of all components of a normalized histogram is 1.  \n",

    "### Why is histogram equalisation used??\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram. It is not necessary that contrast will always be increase in this. There may be some cases were histogram equalization can be worse. In that cases the contrast is decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Generally, histogram equalisation is useful only when the histogram is confined to one region of the image. It does not work when there is large intensity variations, (i.e) where histogram covers a large area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does Histogram equalisation enhance contrast??\n",
    "\n",
    "This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the usable data of the image is represented by close contrast values. Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values.\n",
