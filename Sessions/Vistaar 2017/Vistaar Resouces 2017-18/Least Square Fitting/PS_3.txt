            -----------------  Least Square Fitting  -------------------------------
 
Introduction:

1.  Least square fitting is a mathematical procedure for finding the best-fitting curve to a 
given set of points

2.  Curve is found by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets (”the residuals”) of 
the given points from the curve.

3.  The offsets can be either vertical or perpendicular offsets. In practice, the vertical 
offsets from a line are almost always minimized instead of the perpendicular offsets

4.  Vertical least squares fitting proceeds by finding the sum of the squares of the vertical 
deviations R^2 of a set of n data points R^2 = sigma[yi − f(a, b)]^2 ; f(a, b) = ax + b

5.  Applying the condition that R^2 to be minimum, we get the solutions for a and b.
Have a look at this page http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html for graphical
explanation and the formulas for a and b.

Questions:

1.  An experimentalist wants to empirically find the value of the ’g’ using a simple pendulum
experiment. A simple pendulum consists of a point mass suspended at the end of a cord of zero
mass. A close approximation to this is a small metal mass on a long, light string or thread. 
In this experiment the time for one complete swing, called the period is noted for various
length of the cord . Readings of the experiment is given in the text file dat1.txt (First column
is square root of length,second column is Time period). Write a python program which takes the 
name of the input file as an agrument (HINT: sys.argv ) and finds the best fit curve (Use the 
formula) and writes the co-efficients of the line (a and b) to another file.

2.  For another experiment, the outcome of an experiment (Y) is given in the attached dat2.txt file.
The input(X) is varied from 0 to 100 in steps of 0.5. Find the linear best fit curve for the same.(
Similar to the prev question take the file name as an argument (make it as an habit in the future) and
write the output to a text file.

3. For both the questions, plot the data points along with the fit line.
